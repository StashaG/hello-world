# hello-world
My First repository

Hi Everyone!

Welcome to my first Github repository. My name is Stacey and I guess you could call me a "codenewbie".  I have a new found love of coding.  It was difficult to choose which programming language to learn first, but I settled on HTML, CSS, and Python. 
I'm learning so much and Udemy.com is a great resource.
